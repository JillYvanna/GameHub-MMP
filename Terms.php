        <br>
        <h3> <u>Renting Games</u></h3>
        
        <p> Minimum Requirement</p>
        <p>By joining this service, you confirm that you meet the following minimum requirements. GameHub reserves the right to cancel without refund any account where we suspect that you do not meet these requirements.</p>
        <p> <b>a. you must be at least 18 years of age. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to join GameHub.</b></p>
        <p><b>b. you must live in the United Kingdom;</b></p>
        <p><b>c. you must have a valid credit or debit card;</b></p>
        <p><b>d. you agree to provide us with personal details (including your name, email address, postal address and credit card details) that are true and current, and you agree to update us if at any time your personal details change by using the appropriate functions in the "My Account" section of the platform.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Upon registering for your free trial, you agree that your debit/credit card will be pre-authorised for the subscription value (one per sign up attempt) to verify your identity, and to protect us from theft and fraud. You understand that this may leave a shadow on your card for up to 10 days and these funds may not be available during this period.</p>
        <p><b>Please note: If using a prepaid card, the funds may not be available for up to 30 days.</b></p>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Delivery and return of Games</u> </h3>   
        <p>We currently use the Royal Mail, first-class postage prepaid, to deliver and return the games you have selected to play. Actual delivery times may vary for you depending on (i) our stock availability, (ii) your delivery address, (iii) when you make your selection and (iv) circumstances impacting delivery by the Royal Mail.<b>// We can connect the courier secion to Royal Mail, when we send information to them anytime we have items that need delivery, so the Royal mail driver comes at the end of the day and picks up the items. </b></p>
        <p>You agree to treat the games and their associated packaging with the utmost care at all times. You agree that you may need to compensateGameHub for any game lost or returned in an unacceptable condition (beyond reasonable wear and tear). You agree to report toGameHub  any possible loss or late delivery of a game to you within 7 days of receipt of the confirmation of game dispatch email you will receive from Gamehub. You agree to complete any paperwork and fulfil any reasonable request to assist Gamehub to obtain compensation for any lost game from Royal Mail.</p>
        <p>When games are reported lost, later than 14 days, our policy is to treat them as lost from when we are notified. You understand that we will not refund any lost subscription or part subscription payments due to your delay in notifying us of a lost game.</p>
        <p>You agree to return only one title per envelope. This ensures that if an envelope is lost in the postal system, only one game will be lost.</p>
        <p>While it is very rare for items to be lost in the postal system we recommend that you obtain a Certificate of Posting, on all games you return to us.</p>
        <p>Where a Certificate of Posting has been obtained for a returned game that is lost in the post, you agree to provide to Gamehub the relevant original Certificate of Posting, within 7 days of the loss being identified (retain a copy for your own records). On receipt of this, we can then dispatch your next rental.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you send your Certificate of Posting to us by recorded delivery or at least obtain another Certificate of Posting.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Use of Games</u></h3>
        <p>You agree that you will be responsible for any use of any games supplied by us to you and that any minor's use of any games will be restricted by you consistent with any applicable age classification applied to that game.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Purchasing Games</u></h3>
        
        <p>Prices and Payment</p>
